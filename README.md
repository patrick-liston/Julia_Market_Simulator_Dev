## Stuff
Sorry this is just a single script which contains a bunch of the functions that are getting used.

If you want to see the order execution process it may be easiet understood by looking at the execute_market_buy or execute_market_sell functions. 
The other functions which execute orders generally follow the same pattern, except with a few nuances in execution order. 

Before uploading this I removed the take-profit orders, but I haven't tested them yet. (Just, something to keep in mind).

Hopefully I will continue to update this file and explain as new stuff gets added. :)
